## 👨‍💼 About Me

I am an electronic engineer with 23 years of experience in the telecommunications industry, specializing in solution architecture, configuration, testing, and support for major carriers. Over the last decade, I transitioned into analytics and technical leadership roles, focusing on provisioning, charging control, and complex problem-solving for large-scale deployments.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Master’s in Data Analytics** at the University of Niagara Falls. My training has deepened my expertise in **Python, Power BI, Tableau, SPSS, and SQL**, as well as statistical modelling, machine learning, data warehousing, and visualization. I am passionate about using data to generate actionable insights, design dashboards, build predictive models, and support business decision-making.
